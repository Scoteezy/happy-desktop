 *
 * Bots are the host's top-level roots in catalog order and tasks the reader's
 * joined tasks in the reader's own order; the subtasks of either are
 * descendants listed under them, never roots of their own. Projects keep the
 * host's arrangement, and a worktree one of those subtasks works in is listed
 * once, as that subtask under its root, so the project leaves it out.
