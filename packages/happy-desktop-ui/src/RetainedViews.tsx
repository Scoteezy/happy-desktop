 *
 * Each view sits in its own React `Activity`. One out of sight is
 * `display: none`, so it takes no space and nothing in it can be focused,
 * clicked, typed into, found, or read by assistive technology; its effects and
 * refs are disconnected, so no listener of its own answers the keyboard or the
 * window, and no store it reads re-renders it. What it hung off the shell
 * through `WindowOverlay` — a menu, a picture viewer — leaves with it, and so
 * does the focus, wherever in the view it was. Its DOM, including where each
 * scrollport was scrolled to, is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * A view out of sight does no work at all: it is frozen as it was last drawn,
 * and whatever its owner hands it meanwhile is not rendered, not even at idle
 * priority. Showing it again draws it once from the content it is given then.
 *
 * Views are placed in the order of their ids rather than of the list, so a view
 * never moves in the DOM — moving one would lose its scroll position — whatever
 * order its owner keeps them in.
