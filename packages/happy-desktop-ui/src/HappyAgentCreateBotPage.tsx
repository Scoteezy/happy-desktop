 * C-238 HappyAgentCreateBotPage — what is decided about a bot before it exists,

 *
 * It is reached from the "+" on the sidebar's Bots heading and rendered as the
 * empty content of a conversation view whose composer is the bot's own: the
 * first message is written down there, where every later one will be, and
 * sending it makes the bot on the way. This panel is everything else.
 *
 * The four faces are the middle of the page, on both axes: the one thing that
 * is decided by looking. Everything else is placed relative to them. Above,
 * at the top of the body, the title and a sentence about what a bot is for,
 * because arriving somewhere should say where you are and why; directly over
 * the faces, the credit for the pack, flush with the leftmost face; to the
 * right of the faces, the die that rolls four more, not counted in what is
 * centred. Below, the name, as wide as the faces, which may be left blank for
 * the host to give from the first message, and Create beside it for making
 * the bot without saying anything to it yet. Nothing here is required.
 *
 * Props only, and every state is directly renderable: fresh, filled in, a
 * creation in flight, one the machine refused, and one whose Happy Agent is
 * away. The draft belongs to the caller, so navigating away and back keeps it.
