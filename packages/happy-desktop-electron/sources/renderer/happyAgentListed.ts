/**
 * The conversations this window's sidebar lists for one Happy Agent: its bots
 * the reader has not hidden, the tasks the reader has joined, the subtasks
 * nested under either at any depth, and — unless the reader hid the Projects
 * section — every session in its projects and their worktrees.
 *
 * It is the one answer to "is this on screen" for everything that speaks for
 * the window as a whole: the connection rail's spinner and dot, the Dock's
 * count, and the completion chime. A conversation the sidebar does not list is
 * silent in all of them, in both directions; a hidden bot and its subtasks, a
 * task the reader never joined and its subtasks, or a session in a hidden
 * project can neither raise those signals nor clear them. Its own unread state
 * stays exactly as the host keeps it, so listing it again brings it back as it
 * was.
 *
 * A folded row's children still count, as a folded project's worktrees always
 * have: folding tidies the list, it does not take work out of the window.
 *
 * Each conversation appears once. A worktree a bot's or task's subtask works in
 * is listed as that subtask, never in the Projects section, so it is read the
 * same way here: under its bot or task, whether or not projects are shown, and
 * not at all when its bot is hidden.
